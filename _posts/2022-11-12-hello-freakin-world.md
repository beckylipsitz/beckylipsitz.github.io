## Glitter. Sorry.

Sorry. I know I think too much. Sorry. I know it's not about me. Sorry.

The world, our whole world, and everyone we know in it, are little germs crawling around an expendable cell in the body of an ancient intergalactic toothless man at a bus stop who just wants a donut and a friend and for the adventures to slow down.

I am covered in glitter. Some got on the donut. Some got on the amphitheater. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for making it about me. I'm sorry.

Centuries ago -- more, even -- an old man was a little baby, with so many older sisters looking out for him, raising him, as the various prospective mothers died off and the little Latvian dad hopped between peddling junk (1910), being a grocery proprietor (1920), a clothing merchant (1930), a grocer again (1940), and coronary thrombosis (1948).

That youngest son decided, that story neatly tied together, that he would wed while his dad was in the hospital. Stories are neater and cleaner when they don't overlap too much. They give a false impression of being unrelated. They read like spin-offs or one-offs or prequels.

Don't be fooled. I'm covered in glitter because that little baby was covered in glitter. His dad got some gold glitter on him. And where did his dad get it from? Where do I put it? It seems to rub off on everything I touch, even when i try not to touch anything.

So there we were, 1948. The old man with the Latvian dad and the gold glitter and the many well-intentioned sisters weds another person, a military nurse, covered in silver glitter, and they transfer their silver and gold glitter to four adorable babies: our uncle, my dad, your dad, and your mom.

This is how nurture works. This is how a pandemic works. This is how love works. This is how insecurity works. We are just saturated in glitter. No one really knows how it was made, or where it originated, or how to remove it.

If god is like water
Everywhere
Required to stay alive
Sometimes too prevalent
Sometimes too absent
In the air we breathe
The majority of what makes us up

Yeah, if god is like that

then maybe god knew to pull the three of us together from our obscure beginnings (Russia, Deep River, Harleysville)
to put us in an airbnb together with a trashcat
to request that we shake all our glitter onto the floor, sweep it into a pile of all three of our combined glitters, and painstakingly, inefficiently, clean each little square off til it shines
til we can see our reflection reflected a million times, one in each shard, like a hall of mirrors
only knowing which way to turn because we have each other
and hoping the next generation sees what we did and feels that it's safe and exciting to enter the funhouse
despite all the destruction it took to build
